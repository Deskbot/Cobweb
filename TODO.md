TODO
====

* make it importable like a real module
    * --save
    * --save-dev
* see how error handling works in practice
    * off the back of this, decide whether/how to add error handling features
* Register the name on npm
* Generate documentation from TSDoc

Maybe
-----

* rename observer to spy?
* Add sub-routing
* compatibility for types of request and response other than the ones built in
